# image processing
Implementation of some image processing algorithms in c++
Here I'm using [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to R/W images.

Here you can find the implementation of
* Filtering:
    * [Filter2D MxN](/image%20processing/code/Filter2D)
    * [Filter2D MxN Separable](/image%20processing/code/SepFilter2D)
    * [Sobel](/image%20processing/code/Sobel)
    * Gaussian (backlog)
* Geometric Transformations:
    * [Scale](/image%20processing/code/Scale)
    * [Resize](/image%20processing/code/Resize)
    * [Wrap Rotate](/image%20processing/code/WrapRotate)
    * [Rotate](/image%20processing/code/Rotate)
    * [Flip](/image%20processing/code/Flip)
    * [Transpose](/image%20processing/code/Transpose)
    * [Translate](/image%20processing/code/Translate)
    * Affine Transformation (backlog)
* Feature Detection
    * [Hough lines](/image%20processing/code/HoughLines)
    * Canny (backlog)
    * Hough circle (backlog)
* Color Manipulation
    * [ColorConversion](/image%20processing/code/ColorConvert)
    * [ConvertBitDepth](/image%20processing/code/ConvertBitDepth)
    * [Flood Fill](/image%20processing/code/FloodFill)
* Image Enhancement
    * Histogram (backlog)
* Image Dithering
    * Floyd-Steinberg (backlog)
