# image processing
Implementation of some image processing algorithms in c++
Here I'm using [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to R/W images.

Here you can find the implementation of
* [Scale](/image%20processing/code/Scale)
* [Resize](/image%20processing/code/Resize)
* [Hough lines](/image%20processing/code/HoughLines)
* [Filter2D MxN](/image%20processing/code/Filter2D)
* [Filter2D MxN Separable](/image%20processing/code/SepFilter2D)
* [ColorConversion](/image%20processing/code/ColorConvert)
* [ConvertBitDepth](/image%20processing/code/ConvertBitDepth)
* [Sobel](/image%20processing/code/Sobel)
* Gaussian
* Canny (backlog)
* Hough circle (backlog)
* Floyd–Steinberg (backlog)
* Histogram (backlog)
* Geometric Transformations (backlog)
