Implementation of some image processing algorithms in c++
Here I'm using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) as a tool to R/W images and other GUI operations.
You can find the implementation of
* [Scale](/image%20processing/Scale)
* [Resize](/image%20processing/Resize)
* [Hough lines](/image%20processing/HoughLines)
* [Filter2D MxN](/image%20processing/Filter2D)
* [Filter2D MxN Separable](/image%20processing/SepFilter2D)
* Sobel (in progress)
* ColorConversion (in progress)
* Canny (backlog)
* Hough circle (backlog)
* Floyd–Steinberg (backlog)
* Histogram (backlog)
* Geometric Transformations (backlog)
