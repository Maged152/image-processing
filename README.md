Implementation of some image processing algorithms in c++
Here I'm using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) as a tool to R/W images and other GUI operations.
You can find the implementation of
* Scale
* Hough lines (backlog)
* Hough circle (backlog)
* Canny (backlog)
* Floyd–Steinberg (backlog)
* Filter2D NxN (backlog)
* Filter2D NxN Separable (backlog)
* Histogram (backlog)
* Geometric Transformations (backlog)
